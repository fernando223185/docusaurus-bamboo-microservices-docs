# 📘 Introduction

This microservice receives **Purchase Orders** data from **E-Commerce**.

The Purchase Order Integration API is designed to receive and process purchase orders originating from various e-commerce platforms. These orders are provided through a third-party service responsible for aggregating and managing the data.

Once received, the API validates and transforms the purchase orders so they can be seamlessly integrated into the Bamboo ERP ecosystem, specifically into the following operational modules:

- Order Management

- Packing & Fulfillment

- Shipping & Logistics

This API serves as a bridge between external e-commerce channels and Bamboo ERP’s internal workflows, ensuring that all purchase orders are imported accurately, standardized, and ready for downstream processing.
